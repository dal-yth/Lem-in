# Lem-in
42 school algorithm project.

Score 115/100


The goal of this project is to move your ant colony from one location to another. To make things more interesting, you are asked to move the ants in as few "turns" as possible. Basically the project consist of learning graph traversal algorithms to calculate maximum flow withing a flow network and then intelligently choose paths for ants to travel through.

### Features
- Overlapped adjacency lists
- Dinic's algorithm for maximum flow
- "Smart" bruteforcing

### Running the program
